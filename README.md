## Documentation

The storybook was made using Prismic as part of their #slicecontest. You will notice a lot of the changes I made to the prismic images are using an API that is part of imgix. Prismic does natively use imgix for their images for sizes, compression, formatting, & responsive design. But there are a lot of tricks you can do around styling & design to the image as well. Below, you will see explanations of how I applied this using the imgix API in conjunction with Prismic.

Here is a basic example of modifying a `<prismic-image :field="slice.primary.image" />`:

```
<img :src="slice.primary.image.url + 'insert-imgix-api'" />
```

So if I wanted to add a watermark of an image coming from a prismic field in the slice called waterMarkImage and I always wanted the size of the watermark to be 25% of the size of the main image, I could do it like this:
```
<img :src="slice.primary.image.url + 'mark-w=.25&mark=' + slice.primary.waterMarkImage.url">
```
Here is more info on watermark in the [imgix Documentation](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/rendering/watermark/mark). I hope this gives a basic idea of what I am going to be doing in the following.

### Creating Polaroid Style Images

I wanted to create polaroid style photos. They are actually pretty simple to make, you can just add padding around the photo, but the key is that on the bottom the padding needs to be larger. You can certainly use css to do this, but I wanted to do this with imgix so the image that is indexed later in google still looks like this. I set a general padding number, then a larger pad-bottom number, and then declared what color I wanted these padded areas to be. Below is the imgix API I used to create the padding to make it look like a polaroid photo:
```
pad-bottom=75&pad=10&bg=E8E8EB 
```
Then I begin adding different sizes to the image, add a missing "stamp" as a blend, then create a text field at the bottom of the image in the same style I did above as a watermark, but fill that area with a rich text field from a prismic slice.

Ultimately, I am creating an image that looks like this:

I know creating the image string seems difficult, but the primary goal is to put all of this important info into the image so when it is indexed in google, it will not be lost. Once this is setup correctly in the slice, it is extremely easy to use in the prismic dashboard when creating pages. Other people may do similar ideas like this to make og:images that are tweeted stand out with text, logos, etc.
